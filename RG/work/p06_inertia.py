PHASE 19: Inertia from oscillon collective coordinates and RG dressing.

Old ISPG Appendix 17 used the correct physical intuition:
    acceleration -> retarded self-field -> fore/aft asymmetry -> reaction.

But the old self-force route had two technical hazards:
    1. the finite regular self-field coefficient was inserted as a canonical
       regularization value;
    2. the spatial metric sector was asserted to supply the second half of
       the force, but the full Noether momentum integral was not displayed.

This RG phase keeps that intuition as the dynamical dressing picture, but
closes the leading inertial law at the theorem-gate level by a stronger route:

    localized oscillon energy E0
        -> translational collective coordinate R(t)
        -> Noether four-momentum P^mu = integral T^{0mu} d^3x
        -> Lorentz/Noether effective action
        -> p = gamma M v, M = E0/c^2
        -> F = M a in the nonrelativistic limit.

The same M sources the static Bernoulli/zero-frequency gravitational field:

    phi = -2GM/(c^2 r).

Therefore, in the controlled leading regime:

    m_inertial = m_gravitational = E0/c^2.

No new parameter is introduced.  Retarded self-field asymmetry becomes the
mechanical explanation of how the medium reacts during acceleration; the
collective-coordinate theorem is the clean derivation of the coefficient.

Open before final theory export:
    derive the localized dressed oscillon solution from the active RG action,
    compute its full Noether stress-energy including boundary/dressing terms,
    and verify that the translation zero-mode norm equals the total dressed
    rest energy divided by c^2.
